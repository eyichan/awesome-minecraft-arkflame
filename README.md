## Scope

This list is for Minecraft Java and Bedrock operators, plugin developers, mod developers, network administrators, pack authors, creators, and technical players.

It favors resources that are useful for real servers and real development work: maintained projects, official documentation, source repositories, stable marketplaces, production diagnostics, compatibility tooling, and security-conscious infrastructure.

Not every linked project is open source. Some commercial projects are included because they are widely used or technically relevant. Commercial links are marked when the distinction matters.

---

## Curation Rules

A resource should be included when it satisfies at least one of these conditions:

- It is official, canonical, or maintained by the project owner.
- It is widely used in production Minecraft networks.
- It provides infrastructure, diagnostics, development, security, compatibility, or content-creation value.
- It is historically important and clearly marked as legacy.
- It has enough documentation or source visibility to evaluate before use.

A resource should not be included when it is primarily a piracy launcher, a random direct download, malware-prone, abandoned without historical value, or impossible to evaluate.

---

## Status Legend

- **Recommended** — strong default choice for most users in that category.
- **Specialized** — useful for a specific architecture, version range, or workflow.
- **Commercial** — paid, closed-source, premium, or marketplace-distributed.
- **Legacy** — historically relevant, but not a modern default.
- **Experimental** — useful, but test carefully before production.
- **Caution** — verify maintenance, compatibility, licensing, or trust before use.

## Quick Stack Recommendations

### Modern public survival server

- **Server:** [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper) or [Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/)
- **Proxy:** [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), if running multiple backends
- **Permissions:** [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/)
- **Core commands:** [EssentialsX](https://essentialsx.net/)
- **Rollback:** [CoreProtect](https://www.coreprotect.net/)
- **Protection:** [WorldGuard](https://enginehub.org/worldguard/) or [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention)
- **Profiling:** [spark](https://spark.lucko.me/)
- **Pregeneration:** [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky)
- **Compatibility:** [ViaVersion](https://viaversion.com/) plus [ViaBackwards](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaBackwards), when needed

### High-player spread-out SMP or SkyBlock

- **Server:** [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia), only if your plugin set is compatible
- **Profiler:** [spark](https://spark.lucko.me/)
- **Pregeneration:** [Chunky](https://github.com/pop4959/Chunky)
- **Rule:** Do not assume Bukkit plugins are Folia-safe. Region-threaded scheduling changes plugin correctness.

### Modded Java server

- **Loader:** [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net/), [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/), [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), or [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/)
- **Pack management:** [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)
- **Backups:** [Advanced Backups](https://modrinth.com/project/Jrmoreqs)
- **Profiling:** [spark](https://spark.lucko.me/)

### Folia Compatibility Notes

A plugin is not Folia-safe merely because it starts on Folia. Check whether it uses region schedulers correctly and avoids cross-region world access.

High-risk areas:

- Teleportation across worlds or distant regions.
- Entity tracking and combat checks.
- NPC systems.
- WorldEdit-style mass block changes.
- Global synchronous Bukkit scheduler usage.
- Static caches of world/entity/player state.
- Direct Bukkit API access from async threads.

- [Minecraft Fandom Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki) — Old wiki host. Prefer [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/).
- [LiteLoader](http://www.liteloader.com/) — Legacy mod loader.
- [ModCoderPack](http://www.modcoderpack.com/) — Historical Minecraft decompilation/mapping toolkit.

## Security Notes

- Do not use cracked launchers, random direct downloads, or clients distributed through untrusted file hosts.
- Do not run random plugin jars on production without checking source, reputation, update history, dependencies, and permissions.
- Prefer official project sites, GitHub releases, Modrinth, Hangar, CurseForge, SpigotMC, Polymart, and BuiltByBit over mirror sites.
- For offline-mode networks, put authentication, proxy forwarding, firewall rules, and backend bind addresses under strict review.
- For Velocity, use modern forwarding and configure backend servers correctly.
- Never expose backend Paper/Purpur/Folia servers directly when they trust proxy forwarding.
- Keep backups outside the server machine.
- Test updates on a staging server before production.
- Treat anti-cheat, anti-bot, and DDoS protection as layered systems. No single plugin protects a public network alone.

---

## Contributing

Contributions should improve curation quality, not just add more links.

A good pull request should include:

- The resource name.

- Whether it is open source, commercial, or closed-source when relevant.

### Entry Format

```md
- [Name](https://example.com/) — Clear one-line description. **Status**
```

### Removal Criteria

A resource may be removed or moved to legacy when:

- It is abandoned and no longer useful.
- It links to malware, piracy, or credential theft risk.
- It has no canonical source or trustworthy distribution path.
- It is superseded by a safer, maintained, or more complete project.
- It exists only as a random file-hosted binary.
